# Advanced Risk Analytics in Python

## Overview
Welcome to the **Advanced Risk Analytics in Python** course! This seminar is designed to equip participants with practical skills and knowledge in the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) within the context of quantitative risk management. Drawing from extensive experience in risk management at BMW and currently at Munich RE, the course will cover a range of methods and use cases relevant to risk assessment and management in the financial services and insurance industries.

## Course Structure

### Part 1: Introduction to Methods

#### Day 1: Machine Learning – Introduction to Python
Participants will learn key ML concepts and algorithms, including:
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

The focus will be on practical programming exercises that assess credit and market risks using popular Python libraries such as **scikit-learn** and **pandas**. The goal is to understand how machine learning can add value in risk management scenarios.

#### Day 2: Natural Language Processing – Introduction to Python
This session will cover NLP techniques relevant to the insurance sector, including:
- **Text Vectorization** (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- **Text Classification**
- **Semantic Search**

Participants will explore how these techniques can enhance policy processing and risk assessment of claims in the insurance industry.

### Part 2: Take-Home Assignment
After the introductory sessions, participants will work on a practical problem from the insurance industry using public claims data. They will apply the methods learned to evaluate whether and under what constraints the problem can be solved. Participants will have **2-4 weeks** to complete this assignment and will present their findings in a **short presentation** during a follow-up session lasting **1-2 days**.

## Materials and Resources
All course materials will be provided via GitHub. Prior to the seminar, participants will receive introductory slides explaining Git and GitHub, along with setup instructions to ensure everyone is well-prepared and can seamlessly engage with the course content.

## Prerequisites
Participants should have at least **basic knowledge of Python programming**. This foundational skill is crucial for effectively following the course materials.
